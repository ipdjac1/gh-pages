                        <p>Knowing your client’s business comes from spending time together and you can’t do that with a suitcase in hand. Our approach is to invest in local teams that work to understand your culture, value proposition and the markets you serve. Being side by side, we can share your challenges as well as help you seize opportunities to continuously add value to your business. </p>
                        <p>Beyond the requisite knowledge and certifications, what separates the average consultant from a CELM IT consultant is their people skills. More than technical expertise, our consultants have the soft skills and know-how to harmonize the subtleties of your business and operate within the context of your organization. This means our consultants deliver inherently better business outcomes.</p>
